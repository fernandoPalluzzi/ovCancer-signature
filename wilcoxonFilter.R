##### Reading arguments from command line

# The last column of the data.frame must be a binary vector y,
# representing cases (y = 1) and controls (y = 0).

args <- (commandArgs(TRUE))
data <- read.delim(args[1], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Significance level
alpha <- as.numeric(args[2])


##### Wilcoxon test

for (j in ncol(data)-1) {
	w <- wilcox.test(data[data$y == 1, j], data[data$y == 0, j], conf.int = TRUE)
	W <- rbind(W, data.frame(symbol = colnames(data)[j],
	                         W = w$statistic,
